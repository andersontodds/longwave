# longwave

Testing out @fgasdia's [LongwaveModePropagator.jl](https://github.com/fgasdia/LongwaveModePropagator.jl).

## To do
### lightning sferics
Need to figure out how best to use LongwaveModePropagator for wideband "transmitters".  The goal should be to minimize the number of ````propagate()```` calls.  

Probably best to start with the standard ````Transmitter```` and ````GroundSampler```` example and vary frequency, then see if we can fit an empirical function to amplitude and phase as a function of frequency and distance.

Or, try comparing the amplitude and phase of ````Transmitter```` signals sampled by a ````GroundSampler```` at many different frequencies, with the interpolated amplitude and phase from only a few different input frequencies.

**9/30:** note that WWLLN saves sferic information for Sfiles that pass a dispersion fit check for 8-18 kHz.  While Sfiles contain 64 amplitude samples at 48 kHz, and therefore frequencies up to 24 kHz can be measured, it might be useful to focus on 8-18 kHz if this helps speed up the ````propagate```` run. 

### building ````SegmentedWaveguide````
In order to propagate VLF sferics over long paths, need realistic ````Ground```` and ionosphere parameters.  To start:

* ````Ground```` should be built by making a land/sea/ice mask with at least the same resolution as ````pathgrid````.  Keep only 3 ground parameter (epsilon, sigma) choices in order to maximize segment lenths.  For a uniform ionosphere, a ````SegmentedWaveguide```` can be built by calculating the great circle stroke-Rx path, then defining segments for every contiguous set of land, sea or ice mask cells traversed.

* Ionosphere parameters (````hprime````, ````beta````) should be determined using a day/night mask (i.e. terminator determination).  Later, probably a good idea to use more realistic ionosphere parameters that depend on local time with ~1 hour resolution.

* The ````SegmentedWaveguide```` can then be built by constructing ground segments with the land/sea/ice mask, then determining whether/where the path crosses the terminator line, and splitting the segment spanning the terminator at the terminator line.  Each segment is then assigned day or night ionosphere parameters.

````BuildWaveguide.jl```` can now construct ````SegmentedWaveguide````s based on nominal ground conductivity.  I need to run more tests, but it looks like it will be worth reducing the number of segments as much as possible.  On my Surface, a single path with 13 segments, one frequency, and 1000 ````GroundSampler```` points takes over 400 seconds to run; 19 frequencies (see figure below) takes over 1900 seconds!  After speeding up ground segments, I'll start working on adding segments with varying ionosphere parameters.

## Error log
### [Introduction to defining scenarios](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/basic/)
No issues.
### [File-based I/O](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/io/)
Haven't done this one yet!

### [Mesh grid for mode finding part 1](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/meshgrid/), [part 2](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/meshgrid2/)
No issues.

### [Solvers for ionosphere reflection coefficient](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/integratedreflection/)
 1. Passing ````LMPParams()```` to ````LMP.dRdz```` doesn't work as written in the example:
    ```julia
      prob = ODEProblem{false}(LMP.dRdz, Rtop, (topheight, 0.0), (me, LMPParams()))
    ```
    Bypassed this by passing ````me```` as the only parameter:
    ```julia
      prob = ODEProblem{false}(LMP.dRdz, Rtop, (topheight, 0.0), me)
    ```
    Not sure what the impact on the ODE problem/solution is!
    
 2. ````solverstrings```` includes solver optional arguments, which makes some of them very long, which is difficult to plot.
    ```julia
      solverstrings = replace.(string.(solvers), "OrdinaryDiffEq."=>"")
    ```
    Solution: only use the substring before the first "(":
    ```julia
      solverstrings = string.(first.(split.(string.(solvers), "(")))
    ```
    This change improves the solver evaluation heatmap formatting.

### [Wavefield integration](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/wavefieldintegration/)
 1. Same problem and solution with ````solverstrings```` as above.
 2. My ````hx2_unscaled```` differs slightly from the example; this may be a precision error, so not really a problem.

### [Magnetic field direction](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/magneticfield/)
 1. ````Progress```` and ````next!```` are not found in ````LongwaveModePropagator````.  This is only important for progress logging in ````runlmp````.  To get around this, use:
    ```julia
      using ProgressLogging, TerminalLoggers
      using Logging: global_logger
    ```
    and make the following changes to ````runlmp````:
    ```julia
      function runlmp(inputs, outfile)

        h5open(outfile, "cw") do fid
          # Create batch attributes if they don't already exist
          fid_attrs = attributes(fid)
          haskey(fid_attrs, "name") || (fid_attrs["name"] = inputs.name)
          haskey(fid_attrs, "description") || (fid_attrs["description"] = inputs.description)
          haskey(fid_attrs, "datetime") || (fid_attrs["datetime"] = string(Dates.now()))

          if haskey(fid, "outputs")
              g = fid["outputs"]
          else
              g = create_group(fid, "outputs")
          end
        end

        global_logger(TerminalLogger(right_justify=120))

        @progress for i in eachindex(inputs.inputs)
          # If we've already run this, we can skip ahead
          complete = h5open(outfile, "r") do fid
              g = open_group(fid, "outputs")
              haskey(g, string(i)) ? true : false
          end
          if complete 
              @info @sprintf("Already run %i!", i)
              continue; 
          end

          output = buildrun(inputs.inputs[i])

          h5open(outfile, "r+") do fid
              g = open_group(fid, "outputs")
              o = create_group(g, string(i))
              attributes(o)["name"] = output.name
              attributes(o)["description"] = output.description
              attributes(o)["datetime"] = string(Dates.now())
              o["output_ranges"] = output.output_ranges
              o["amplitude"] = output.amplitude
              o["phase"] = output.phase
          end
          @info @sprintf("Done with %i, next!", i)
        end
      end
    ```
 2. The computed nighttime phase differs by a constant -20 dB offset from both the LWPC and example LMP runs.  Haven't been able to find the error yet.
 

### [Interpreting h' and Î²](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/interpretinghpbeta/)
No issues.

### [Multiple ionospheric species](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/multiplespecies/)
No issues.

### [Density and collision frequency as interpolating functions](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/interpolatingfunctions/)
 1. The example refers to the [FIRI model package](https://github.com/fgasdia/FaradayInternationalReferenceIonosphere.jl) with ````using FIRITools````, when it appears the correct statement should be:
 ```julia
 using FaradayInternationalReferenceIonosphere
 import FaradayInternationalReferenceIonosphere as FIRI
 ```
 All references to ````FIRITools```` in the example should then be replaced with ````FIRI````.

 Also note that ````FaradayInternationalReferenceIonosphere```` requires at least Julia 1.7.1!

### [Ground](https://fgasdia.github.io/LongwaveModePropagator.jl/dev/generated/ground/)
No issues.
